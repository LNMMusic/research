## 1. Overview

**TensorFlow** is an open-source machine learning library developed by the Google Brain team. It is widely used for building and training neural network models. TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that allows researchers to push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers to easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

**Keras** is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research.

## 2. TensorFlow: The Engine Behind Keras

TensorFlow operates by creating a graph of operations and tensors. This approach allows for a high degree of flexibility and efficiency, making TensorFlow suitable for a wide range of machine learning tasks.

### Key Features:

- **Flexibility and Scalability**: TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs and is available on 64-bit Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile computing platforms.
- **Eager Execution**: TensorFlow's eager execution allows for more interactive and intuitive development.
- **Robust ML Production Anywhere**: TensorFlow can be deployed on almost any device or platform, including servers, edge devices, and mobile apps.

## 3. Keras: High-Level API for TensorFlow

Keras provides a simpler, more user-friendly interface for building and training neural network models. It is designed to create models through its high-level building blocks such as layers, optimizers, and loss functions.

### Key Features:

- **User-Friendly**: Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases.
- **Modular and Composable**: Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.
- **Easy to Extend**: Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research.

## 4. Installation

To get started with TensorFlow and Keras, you need to install the TensorFlow package, which includes Keras:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## 5. Basic Concepts

### 5.1 Tensors

Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays with a uniform type (called a `dtype`). You can see them as an extension of 2-d matrices to higher dimensions.

### 5.2 Computational Graphs

TensorFlow works by building a graph of defined computations. Nothing is computed or stored in this graph. It's simply a way of organizing and describing the operations you've defined.

## 6. Conclusion

TensorFlow and Keras offer a powerful combination for building and training advanced machine learning models. While TensorFlow provides the robustness and versatility, Keras adds ease of use and simplicity for quick prototyping.
