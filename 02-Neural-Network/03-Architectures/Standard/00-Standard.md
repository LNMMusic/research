# Standard Neural Network Architecture in Keras

This documentation provides a detailed guide on building a standard neural network architecture using Keras, a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow. The guide includes Python code examples for each section, focusing on the key steps in the process: data pre-processing, building the model, and compiling the model.
